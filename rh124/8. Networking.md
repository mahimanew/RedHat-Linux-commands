# Networking

### Static IP vs DHCP

- IP stands for internet protocol which is assigned to your computer so it can access the network.

- private IP is assigned for internal communication and public is for internet/external communication.

- static Ip ---> does not change at the time reboot 
- dynamic IP ---> changes after system reboot

```
# get the IP in Linux 
ifconfig
# new command
ip addr
```


### OS network components:

#### Network interface
 - A network interface is a point of interaction between a computer system and a network, enabling the system to send and receive data over that network. 
#### MAC address
 -  (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use in communications on the physical network segment.

#### Subnet mask
  - A subnet mask is a 32-bit number used in IPv4 network, Subnet masks are typically written in dotted-decimal notation. Example: 255.255.255.0


#### gateway
  - allowing communication between different networks. It typically connects a local network to external networks

#### DNS (Domain name system)
  - It translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 93.184.216.34)
